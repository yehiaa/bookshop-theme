                 Alexandria Publishing (or Alexandria Library for Publishing & Distribution) is a publishing house specialized in 
                 educational books and curriculum that was founded in 1990 on a solid foundation in the field of publishing since 1948.

                  Our main focus is book series that teach English and French as foreign/second languages, as well as computer and mathematics for elementary and middle schools, and a few series and activity books for kindergarten-level students.
